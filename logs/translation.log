 Test Data
This dataset contains two test samples provided by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI.
These samples include a markdown table and an English text passage, which can be used to test an
English-to-Chinese translation software supporting both text and table formats.
Text testing
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the English
alphabet at least once. Pangrams are often used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related
tools. In addition to English, there are pangrams in many other languages. Some pangrams are more
difficult to construct due to the unique characteristics of the language.

这个数据集包含了两个由OpenAI的人工智能语言模型ChatGPT提供的测试样本。
这些样本包括一个Markdown表格和一个英文文本段落，可用于测试支持文本和表格格式的英译中翻译软件。
文本测试
快速的棕色狐狸跳过了懒狗。这个全字母句包含了英语字母表中的每一个字母。全字母句经常被用来测试字体、键盘和其他与文本相关的工具。除了英语，许多其他语言中也有全字母句。由于语言的独特特点，有些全字母句更难构造。
